            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, India. From a young age, Bose was known for his intellectual prowess and his strong will. After attending the prestigious Presidency College in Calcutta, he moved to England to pursue higher studies. Despite his academic success, Bose’s deep passion for India’s freedom pulled him back to join the nationalistic movement.</p>
